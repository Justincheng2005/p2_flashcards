Submitted by: **Justin Cheng**

This web app: allows users to learn data structures by going through flashcards and guessing the data structure by the definition.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [x] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [x] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**
- [x] **A next button is displayed on the card and can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards
- [ ] A user's answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
- [ ] A counter displays the user's current and longest streak of correct responses
- [ ] A user can mark a card that they have mastered and have it removed from the pool of answers as well as added to a list of mastered cards

## Notes

The hardest parts of this challenge were  figuring out first how to get input and have it update on the screen and realizing that because set functions are asyncronous that I had to manually set the current card content instead of relying on using the index for everything.
